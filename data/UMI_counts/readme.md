## Readme

In the folders above, there are UMI counts for both reference and alternative alleles of each testable varaint. The files are named in this format `CXSpYMZ`, where `CX` identifies the chip, `SpY` identifies the subpool of variants cloned together and `MZ` identifies the molecule and replicate number. For example, `C1Sp2D3` refers to `Chip1 - Subpool2 - DNA Rep 3`.

In most cases we used the same pre-transfection DNA counts from HEK293 data to normalize RNA in HeLa. Therefore the matching DNA counts for the HeLa samples can be found under HEK293 in the corresponding parent folder. The only exception is in the rare_3utr data where we only assayed variants in HeLa cells.
